Hunger significantly enhances reward-driven learning for food, as shown by the higher relative rate difference for food (1.738) compared to money (0.321). The Wilcoxon Signed-Rank test (statistic = 65, p = 0.1429) suggests a notable but not statistically significant shift, with greater variability in food choices (higher SEM = 4.073 vs. 0.693 for money). This indicates that in a fasted state, individuals prioritize immediate food rewards, showing higher impulsivity and increased learning sensitivity, while monetary decision-making remains relatively stable.

This effect aligns with evolutionary adaptation, where hunger activates dopaminergic pathways, making food more rewarding and increasing preference for immediate consumption. Since food is a primary reinforcer, it directly satisfies a biological need, leading to state-dependent learning shifts. In contrast, money, a secondary reinforcer, maintains its abstract value regardless of physiological state, resulting in minimal behavioral change in the fasted condition.
