# 🧠 Behavioral-Decision-Making-Analysis-Under-Physiological-States

An exploratory research project analyzing how different physiological states (e.g., hunger, fatigue) influence human decision-making using statistical and psychological modeling techniques.

## 🧪 Overview

This study simulates and analyzes behavioral decisions under manipulated physiological states to identify patterns of risk-taking, impulsivity, and reward sensitivity. Data was collected from synthetic simulations and observational models.

## 📊 Features

- Psychological variable modeling (risk, reward, stress)
- CSV-based decision dataset analysis
- Statistical comparisons across physiological states
- Visual data plots of behavioral trends
